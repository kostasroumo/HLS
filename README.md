# High Level Synthesis
---
This work is about HLS course, Duth ECCE 9 Semester and contains 4 projects on High Level Synthesis working with C++ and  Catapult.
---

## Project 1
---
- In exercise 1 and 2 we have to write simple  C++ code and in exercise 3 we work with a data flow graph.
-  Exercise 1: Write  function, c++ code that computes the  sum of each row of a 2-D array.The sum of the elements of the i-th row appears in the position i of the row_sum table. <br/>
  
          template<int N,int M>
          void compute_row_sum(short a[N],[M], short row_sum[N])
