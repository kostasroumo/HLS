# High Level Synthesis
---
This work is about HLS course, Duth ECCE 9 Semester and contains 4 projects on High Level Synthesis working with C++ and  Catapult.
---

## Project 1
---
  In exercise 1 and 2 we have to write simple  C++ code and in exercise 3 we work with a data flow graph.In addition,  src file contains testing.cpp which is a testbench file for ex1.cpp and ex2.cpp.

-  **Exercise 1**: Write  function, c++ code that computes the  sum of each row of a 2-D array.The sum of the elements of the i-th row appears in the position i of the row_sum table. <br/>
  
          template<int N,int M>
          void compute_row_sum(short a[N][M], short row_sum[N])
<br/>


- **Exercise 2**: We have to apply wave sort in 1-D array on two steps.
    - Step 1: Apply sorting algorithm.
  
    - Step 2: Run  through all the elements of the table and change the positions of the neighbouring elements every two. <br/>
     
           template<int N>
           void wave_sort(int a[N]) 
    <br/>

- **Exercise 3:**
